# PMQMC
Permutation Matrix representation Quantum Monte Carlo

## Description
PMQMC is a C implementation of a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation using permutation matrix representation. 

The implementation supports two types of update algorithms:
1. Composite updates (standard local and global moves)
2. Worm updates (global updates that can be more efficient for systems with topological constraints)

## Usage
To compile the program, simply run:
```bash
make
```

To run the simulation:
```bash
./pmqmc <input_file>
```

For example:
```bash
./pmqmc pmqmc.in
```

## Input File Generation
The input file `pmqmc.in` is generated by a Python preprocessing script that converts a Hamiltonian expressed as a sum of Pauli operators into the format required by the C simulation code.

An example script can be found in the `examples/` directory:
```bash
python examples/1d_xy.py
```

This script generates the `pmqmc.in` file which can then be used with the C program.

## Input File Format
The input file contains all the simulation parameters and Hamiltonian definition. Key parameters include:
- `N`: Number of sites/qubits
- `NOP`: Number of permutation operators
- `NCYCLES`: Number of cycle completion operators
- `BETA`: Inverse temperature
- `TSTEPS`: Number of thermalization steps
- `STEPS`: Number of measurement steps
- `STEPS_PER_MEASUREMENT`: How often to record measurements
- `QMAX`: Maximum queue size for operators
- `NBINS`: Number of bins for histogram
- `WORM`: Boolean (True/False) to select update algorithm

The WORM parameter determines which update algorithm to use:
- `WORM True`: Use worm updates
- `WORM False`: Use composite updates

## Testing
To run all tests:
```bash
make test
```
